# MDmis - A biophysical machine learning approach for missense variants in disordered protein regions

In this project, we leverage molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of long time scales of intrinsicially disordered regions of human proteome. We predict ClinVar and Deep Mutational Scanning labels of pathogenicity using features derived from MD trajectories
to capture biophysical representation of residues and mutational effects. We perform an analysis of pathogenic variants in IDRs using features from MD, in tandem with
functional annotations of protein residue sites and protein regions. 

This repository contains the code used to train MDmis, perform analysis, run simulations of mutated sequences, and extract features. All code uses Python.
