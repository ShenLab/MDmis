# MDmis - A biophysical machine learning approach for missense variants in disordered protein regions

In this project, we leverage molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of long time scales of intrinsicially disordered regions of human proteome. We try to understand how AlphaMissense and ESM1b predict pathogenic variants in IDRs, and use MDmis to interpret predictions in addition to identify subtypes of pathogenic variation. 
We perform an analysis of pathogenic variants in IDRs using features from MD, in tandem with
functional annotations of protein residue sites and protein regions, and we perform simulations of mutated primary sequences to verify and supplement our hypotheses from Wild-type simulations.

This repository contains the code used to train MDmis, perform analysis, run simulations of mutated sequences, and extract features. All code uses Python and Command Line.
