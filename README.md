# MDmis - A biophysical machine learning approach for missense variants in disordered protein regions

In this project, we leverage molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of long time scales of intrinsicially disordered regions of human proteome. We predict ClinVar and Deep Mutational Scanning labels of pathogenicity using features derived from MD trajectories
to capture biophysical representation of residues and mutational effects.
